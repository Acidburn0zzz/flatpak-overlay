# flatpak-overlay
A Gentoo ebuild overlay for the [Flatpak](http://flatpak.org/) application distribution format.

Note that this only installs the flatpak application. It does not track actual applications installed by flatpak like Gentoo would. As such it is recommended to only use it for per-user application installs to not contaminate your base system as it is.
